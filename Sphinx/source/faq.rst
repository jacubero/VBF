Why does this library exist?
============================

The stated mission of VBF is to be viable free open source library for analysing Vector Boolean Functions used in ciphers. VBF uses best-of-breed free open source Number Theory Library called NTL by Victor Shoup.

Who is behind this project?
============================

At this moment, Jose Antonio Alvarez is the only person who is contributing to develop this code. If you are interested in contributing to it, please send a comment to the email: vbflibrary@gmail.com

Why is VBF free/open source?
============================

I agree with Sage Authors: "A standard rule in the mathematics community is that everything is laid open for inspection. The Sage project believes that not doing the same for mathematics software is at best a gesture of impoliteness and rudeness, and at worst a violation against standard scientific practices. An underlying philosophical principle of Sage is to apply the system of open exchange and peer review that characterizes scientific communication to the development of mathematics software. Neither the Sage project nor the Sage Development Team make any claims to being the original proponents of this principle"

What are VBF prerequisites?
=============================

The only prerequisite is to have a version of NTL library installed on the computer in which the VBF library is executed.
