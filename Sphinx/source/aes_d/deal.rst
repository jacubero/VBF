Description
===========

DEAL (Data Encryption Algorithm with Larger blocks) is a symmetric block cipher derived from the Data Encryption Standard (DES). The design was proposed in a report by Lars Knudsen in 1998, and was submitted to the AES competition by Richard Outerbridge (who notes that Knudsen had presented the design at the SAC conference in 1997).

DEAL has eight 6x4 S-boxes: S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8. They are the same as DES S-boxes and you can see an analysis in :ref:`DES <secExamplesDES>`.
